        "content": "Today was one of those days that started normal but ended with a knot in my stomach. My 14-year-old daughter and I went grocery shopping, like we always do. We stick to Save on Foods because, honestly, it’s all we can afford right now. Things have been tight since my wife got laid off, and every dollar counts. After grabbing what we needed, we stopped at the drugstore to pick up some cold medicine for her. It wasn’t until we got home and I was unpacking the bags that I noticed something off. In my daughter’s backpack was an expensive hair product—one of those high-end brands she’s been obsessing over for weeks. I knew we didn’t buy it, and when I asked her about it, she froze. After a long pause, she admitted she took it from the drugstore. She said she didn’t want to ask me for it because she knows how stressed I’ve been about money, and she didn’t want to add to it. Part of me understands. She’s at that age where fitting in feels like life or death, and all her friends have these fancy things. But the other part of me is furious and heartbroken. Stealing is wrong, plain and simple, and I don’t want her to think it’s okay to take things just because we can’t afford them. At the same time, I know she’s already feeling guilty and embarrassed. She’s a good kid, and this is the first time something like this has happened. I’m torn. Do I make her return the product and apologize to the store, even though it might humiliate her? Or do I let it go this once, sit her down, and have a serious talk about why what she did was wrong and how to handle these feelings in the future?",
